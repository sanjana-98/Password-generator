# Password-generator
This is a password generator application built using HTML,CSS and JavaScript. 
User can decide length and complexity of password and once the password is generated, user can automatically copy to clipboard. 
Strength of password is indicated using color indicator.
Concepts like DOM Manipulation on slider and checkboxes
Event listeners are used to capture user interactions. For example, when the slider value changes or the "Generate" button is clicked, the code responds to these events.
The code generates random characters for the password, including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and symbols. It uses JavaScript's Math.random() function for randomization.
Conditional Logic: Conditional statements are used to determine the password's strength and to generate the password based on user choices.
